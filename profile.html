        <h2>Behind the Story of Our School</h2>
        <p>
            The preliminary plans of commencing Mahinda Rajapaksa College was started to discuss in September 2012, with
            the honourable Minister Dalas Alahapperuma, the pathfinder of Matara. The major aim of establishing a
            Mahinda Rajapaksa College in Matara was to develop this school as a historic turning point of Sri Lankan
            education culture by providing all most all the modern facilities to the school. with that aim in mind, the
            Department of Education was seeking a proper place for this school. At last the final decision came into
            light. It ase to take two acres in a place called, Wallamadama Rassandeniya. The buildings in this land were
            built for Mahamaya Balika Vidyalaya, Matara as it was heavily damaged by Tsunami in the year 2004.

            AS Mahamaya Balika Vidyalaya has rejected shifting to this new land due to the belifs of People Mahinda
            Rajapaksa College was decided to establish here. The name of this place "Rassandeniya" was changed as it is
            belived to be harmful for an image of a school. It is named as "Sarasavi Uyana" enlightening the true image
            of a school.
